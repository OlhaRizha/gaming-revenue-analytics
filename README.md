# Gaming Revenue Dashboard ðŸŽ®ðŸ“Š

## Project Description (EN)
This project is part of my Data Analytics diploma.  
The main goal was to build a dashboard for analyzing **revenue metrics** in a gaming project.  
The dashboard helps product managers track changes in revenue and paid users over time and understand the factors that drive these changes.
